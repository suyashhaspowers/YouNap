napping time thing (nap cycles) - perfect the cycle

napping is supposed to re-energize etc.Therefore, it is important to nap and wake up at a time such that yo

A power nap is a 20 minute long nap which is used to quickly
boost the energy and alertness of the napper. For this nap, the napper stays within the lighter stages
of NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep, thus preventing the napper from reaching deep stages of sleep. This allows
the napper to wake up with ease.

The recall nap is a 60 minute long nap which helps the napper remember 
faces, places, and faces with more ease. For this nap, the napper reaches
deeper stages of sleep (slow-wave sleep). However, since an entire sleep
cycle isn't completed, the napper may wake up feeling unvigilant and tired for some time.


A full nap is 90 minutes long which undergoes the full length of one sleep cycle. This is considered
the most ideal nap length as the napper passes through all the light and deep (REM and dreaming) stages of sleep.
Going through a full sleep cycle greatly improves procdural and emotional memory while
also boosting the napper's creativity levels. Furthermore, waking up from this time of nap is the easiest
because the napper wakes up upon the completion of an entire sleep cycle.

According to Dr. Sara Mednik, the perfect time to take a full 90 minute nap is the point in the 
day when REM and slow-wave sleep intersect. This is a perfectly balanced state in which REM and slow-wave sleep are equally proportioned. The time of day where this
occurs is solely dependent on the time an individual wakes up. Hence, simply input the time of day you woke up and determine what time you should start
and finsih your nap.
